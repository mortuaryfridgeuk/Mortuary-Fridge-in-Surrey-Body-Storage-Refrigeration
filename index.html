                </p>
                <p>
                    This will depend on the size of the cabinet and the amount of cabinet units required.
                </p>

                    Other factors that can increase the cost of these cold rooms include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Larger cabinet designs that require specialised installation
                    Bespoke design work to fit into a limited space <br>
                    Custom storage layouts to allow all doors/trays to open up cleanly <br>
                    The size of the freezers holding the storage cabinets <br>
                    Additional steps needed to ensure that temperatures remain steady <br>
                    Any other equipment that may be needed to either install or manage the cold rooms <br>

                <h2>Benefits of Mortuary Rooms</h2>
                <p>
                    Hospital mortuary cold rooms offer many benefits:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proper cold storage for the dead, preventing decomposition
                    Full compliance with storage procedures for corpses in a range of situations/states <br>
                    Safe storage of bodies, minimizing damage to cadavers <br>
                    Isolation of corpses to remove discomfort and the risk of disease <br>
                    Secure cabinet door systems that allow each corpse to be easily sorted for later retrieval <br>
                    Easy but secure access to the entire cold room <br>
                    Additional storage for supplies and equipment needed to move bodies properly <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work hard to deliver mortuary refrigeration solutions in Surrey that are both convenient and effective. Each of our mortuary cold room designs is installed to the customers’ needs, offering as many benefits as possible within the space constraints of the premises it needs to fit into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Storing the deceased properly is important, and we do our best to deliver cold room options that suit the expected standards of corpse storage while also being practical.
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Mortuary Chambers</h2>
                <p>
                    Mortuary solutions can feature a variety of cabinet types, which all suit different storage requirements and purposes in hospitals or other businesses/sites. These include:
                </p>
                <h3>Positive Temperature Mortuary Refrigerator Surrey</h3>
                <p>
                    A positive temperature mortuary refrigeration system keeps dead bodies in Surrey between 2°C and 4°C, preserving bodies without preventing decomposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is useful for situations where the deceased are moved soon after arriving since these units are more efficient if the bodies are not being kept long-term.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> <img style="height: 400px; width: 100%" src="https://mortuary-fridge.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2.png" alt="">

                <h3>Negative Temperature Mortuary Refrigerator Surrey</h3>
                <p>
                    A negative temperature mortuary refrigeration system keeps bodies at between -10°C and -50°C, meaning the bodies decompose significantly slower.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is important for long-term storage in Surrey, such as when a corpse identification is not finalised, and this may take weeks, as the corpse stays a higher quality for longer.
                </p>
                <h2>What is a Mortuary Cold Room?</h2>
                <p>
                    A mortuary cold room is a refrigerated room used to store corpses. These are often seen in hospitals, funeral homes, or anywhere else where bodies are expected to be retrieved or stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cold rooms often use shelf or cabinet systems with an individual door/tray for each corpse, with the room itself also having a sealable door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows the room to stay refrigerated long-term, preserving the quality of the cadavers and preventing fast decay.
                </p>
                <h2>Mortuary Fridges for Funeral Directors</h2>
                <p>
                    Funeral directors can benefit from the same units that hospitals do, although often on a smaller scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can install a way for funeral directors to store the corpse before funeral preparation – for example, if a body is recovered in November, but the funeral is arranged for January.
                </p>
                <h2>Hospital Morgue Cold Rooms</h2>
                <p>
                    We can install a range of hospital morgue systems in Surrey, aiming for high levels of quality and reliability to ensure that each corpse is preserved as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can discuss our work with clients and walk them through the installation steps needed to get a larger-scale space completed.
                </p>
                <h2>Cooling and Body Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    Our systems focus on effective refrigeration, providing customers with reliable cooling to make storing corpses easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can walk clients through the specifics of these storage systems and the meaning behind each design choice we will have to make regarding the refrigeration systems.

                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <h3>What are Body Fridges Called?</h3>
                <p>
                    A body fridge is often called a morgue, although these names may vary depending on context.
                </p>
                <h3>How Cold is a Mortuary Fridge?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most mortuary fridges are either kept between 2°C and 4°C or -10°C and -50°C.
                </p>
                <h3>How Long Will a Body Last in Refrigeration?</h3>
                <p>
                    A refrigerated body tends to last around three to four weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although this can be longer in certain cases and with proper care.
                </p>
                <h3>Do Undertakers Have Fridges?</h3>
                <p>
                    Undertakers tend to have at least a small fridge system for corpses, even if this just means a one-or-two-door cabinet
                </p>
                <p>
                    A walk in fridge is most common, so numerous bodies can be stored.
                </p>

                <h3>What’s the Difference Between a Morgue and a Mortuary?</h3>
                <p>
                    A morgue takes in the dead for identification or that needs to be stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The term mortuary generally refers to the same thing in the context of funeral homes.
                </p>
                <h3>How Cold are Morgue Drawers?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most morgue drawers are kept between either 2°C and 4°C or -10°C and -50°C, depending on the level of refrigeration needed.
                </p>
                <h3>Are Morgue Fridges Ventilated?</h3>
                <p>
                    Morgue fridges still need ventilation to ensure safety and to prevent bad odours from building up in the enclosed space as the corpses decompose.
                </p>
                <h2>Morgue Room Safety Standards / Environmental Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    A safety shower and eye wash station must be included nearby
                    A safe environment for the deceased is needed, allowing them to be handled with dignity <br>
                    Bodies with possible infections need a safe, isolated place to be stored <br>
                    Floors must be kept clean, and slippery surfaces must be minimized <br>
                    Ventilation must be supplied and constantly active, even when the room is empty. <br>
                </p>

                      <p style="text-align: center; color: #ffffff;">We absolutely love the service provided. Their approach is really friendly but professional. We went out to five different companies and found Mortuary Fridge to be value for money and their service was by far the best. Thank you for your really awesome work, we will definitely be returning!</p>
